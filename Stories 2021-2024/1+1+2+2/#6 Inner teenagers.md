### #6 Inner teenagers

This story continues [#5 Breaking symmetry](./#5%20Breaking%20symmetry.md). So far, ABCDEFGHIJKL_O_X has been used. This story introduces N and further develops I and H.

Psychiatrist Doctor H (short for Henry) gets an emergency call from his patient I. I met a gorgeous lady N (short for Nelena). I felt very romantic from the first hug, and they started dating. He is highly concerned with N's fantasies. N wants I to dress like a cop, handcuff, and punish her.

H reassures I that such things are normal. H hypothesizes that, most probably, N, as a child, was always trying to do "the right thing." She made something in her early childhood that she perceived as really wrong. So wrong that she suppressed those memories into her subconscious. However, even though she cannot remember the underlying incident, she knows there was a transgression and, thus, she needs to be punished to be forgiven. As she was growing older, the original problem of the inner child transformed into the issue of the inner teenager by getting sexual roleplaying hues.

I asks H to help him and consult N. H tells I that it would require consent and will of N for him to proceed. Moreover, H believes that N would be offended to know that I talked to him about her fantasies. So, the ideal way is for I to become a cop who arrests N for some transgression and then "understands and forgives."

I gives deep thought to H's analysis and devises a brilliant plan. He buys a cop's hat online and handcuffs. The next time I visits N's house, he brings a cop's hat and handcuffs. When N greets him, I informs her that he secretly applied to the police academy. He went through some training already; today, he got his uniform. Unfortunately, he could sneak out of the academy with only the hat and handcuffs. N gets super horny and demands that I should immediately put on his hat, handcuff her to anything, and start punishing her gently. I declines and counters that there should be a real transgression, like a traffic violation, for him to have a reason to arrest and punish her. I was expecting N to confess her childhood misdeed and that they would discuss her issue. Instead, it turns out that he gave N an idea.

N tells I that she needs to do some grocery shopping to buy a missing ingredient for the soup. Because it is late and dark outside, she asks I to drive with her. I is puzzled but reluctantly agrees. I goes to the car, N secretly takes his hat and handcuffs with her.

As N is driving, she passes on a red light. I tells her to pay attention because she broke the rule. On the next red light, N turns right under the sign "No Turn on Red." I asks her "What is going on?" N ignores his question. Shortly thereafter, she turns on a quiet, empty road, turns off the lights, and continues driving in total darkness.  
-- [I] Look, darling! You made 3 traffic violations in a row. Why are you driving without headlights at night? Please pull over to the curb and stop.  
-- [N obliges. Once N shuts off the engine...] Third time is a charm. Or, as a cop would say, the third time is an arrest.

Having said that, N gives I a bag with his cop's hat and handcuffs. Now, I understands what kind of a game N wished to play. He complies. He puts on his cop's hat, gets out of the car, walks around, and knocks on a driver's window. N lowers it.  
-- [N] Is there a problem, officer?  
-- [I] Mam, do you realize that you have violated 3 times traffic laws three times? [I states her violations...]  
--[N] Yes. But those are nothing. Surely, you will understand and forgive.  
-- [I] Sorry, Mam. But I have to arrest you.  
-- [N] Really?! [N swears dirty at him...]  
-- [I] Mam, you are disrespecting a cop on duty. Please step out of the car.

N steps out of the car. I turns her around and handcuffs her from the back. I reads her Miranda rights. Then I opens the backdoor of the car, squeezing her in, putting his hand on her head to be sure that she does not bump her head. And then I drives with N home.  
-- [N] Why have you not brought me to a police station?  
-- [I] I will. I just stopped at my house to visit a bathroom.

I brings N to the kitchen, and then he leaves and comes back with a notebook and a pen. I tells N that he will interrogate her at his home. N gladly agrees. I asks questions, and N readily confesses her traffic violations.

I always wished to marry N. Since they were dating, he considered making her a marriage proposal but was too shy to do so. I knows that N negatively thinks about marriage and, on one occasion, even said that marriage is an unnecessary suffering and only stupid people will selfinflict this punishment without any reasonable cause. So, I decides to trick N.  
-- [I] Your transgressions do require jailing!  
-- [N] Is there any other way to proceed, officer?  
-- [I] Yes. If you give me your consent to punish you, you will be forgiven.  
-- [N] Yes. I do.  
-- [I] You are going to marry me next week. Me, being your husband, is the punishment for you. And, now, you are forgiven.

N is furious. But she keeps true to her consent. Next week, they marry, signing the proper papers at the town hall. That very evening I comes home with flowers, dreaming romantically. However, N tells him that though she agreed to the marriage, she has not consented to physical love, and it will be a spiritual/platonic marriage till he properly arrests, handcuffs, and punishes her.  
-- [I] Darling, would you like to do some grocery shopping this evening?  
-- [N] Yes. But this time you drive.

I agrees to a challenge. I takes his cop's hat and handcuffs along. During the ride he gets a brilliant idea. I tells N about his training to catch shoplifters. Now, N understands what kind of a game I wishes to play. At the shop, N provokes I.  
-- [N] Dear, do you want a red or green apple?  
-- [I] I prefer peaches. [N takes a peach and, offensively looking in his eyes, bytes a juicy piece.]  
-- [I] You know, eating fruits in the shop is against the law?  
-- [N] Yes, I do. [N brazenly takes a pomegranate and puts it into her handbag.]  
-- [I] I'm warning you: it is the second time you are breaking the law.  
[Finally, they are scanning items at a self-checkout. N deliberately misses one item.]  
-- [I] Enough is enough. It is the third time you have done the wrong in the grocery shop. Please scan the item correctly. Let's avoid an ugly scene here. You'll pay, we will step out, and I will arrest you.  
-- [N] I agree.

They go to their car and load groceries into the trunk. Once done, N steps on I's foot and again verbally disrespects him. I puts on his cop's hat.  
-- [I] Mam, you have physically abused the cop. I am going to arrest you. Please turn around.  
She gladly complies with obvious excitement. I handcuffs her from the back. I reads her Miranda rights. Then I opens the backdoor of the car, squeezing her in, putting his hand on her head to be sure that she does not bump her head. And then I drives with N home.  
-- [N] Why have you not brought me to a police station?  
-- [I] I will. I just stopped at my house to unload groceries and visit a bathroom.

I brings N to the kitchen, and then he leaves and comes back with a notebook and a pen. I tells N that he will interrogate her at his home. N gladly agrees. I asks questions, and N readily confesses her shoplifting violations.  
-- [I] Your transgressions do require jailing!  
-- [N] Is there any other way to proceed, officer?  
-- [I] Yes. If you give me your consent to punish you, you will be forgiven.  
-- [N] Yes. I do.  
-- [I] You are going to get an erotic massage.

I moves N to the bedroom. I gently caresses N. But it was a long and busy day for N, full of excitement. N was so tired that she fell asleep before I started removing her clothes. While N is sleeping, I takes advantage of her. I brings 3 other handcuffs. (Handcuffs came in a pack of four.) I spreads N and chains her legs and arms to the corners of the bed. During those manipulations, I disturbs N's sleep enough that she starts mumbling something in her dream. I lowers his ear to listen tentatively. N is talking about her childhood sin in her dream. It is so tiny and funny. Her childhood's wrong is so easy to "understand and forgive." Unfortunately, I was leaning too close to N's face, listening to her confessions. His beard tickled her nose. N sneezes and wakes up. N is pleasantly surprised to find herself securely chained by four handcuffs to the bed. And, with a new energy after a short sleep, she is excited to continue with the game.  
-- [N] What have I done wrong?  
-- [I] Nothing.  
-- [N] Why have you chained me to bed?  
-- [I] Just for fun. [I decided to keep a secret from her that he knows her secret.]  
-- [N] I see... [she said that in a deeply seducing voice] ... Just do it!

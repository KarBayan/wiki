### #2 Butterfly ending

This story continues from [#1 Alphabet soup](#1%20Alphabet%20soup.md). The first story used ABCDEF_O, and the second one will add G.

A (short for Amelie) gets on a reality TV show akin to "Big Brother." So while her husband C (short for Charles) works and manages the household, it is now his father G (short for George) who is taking care of their daughter E (short for Elisabeth).

G watched an episode from the TV show with his granddaughter E. They observed a lot of drama. There was also an endurance competition where A and others had to walk on a spinning platform resembling a merry-go-round -- the last one to give up without food, sleep, and using the bathroom wins.  
-- [E wonders] Why do my mother volunteers to suffer?  
-- [G] Because if she wins those competitions and succeeds in staying in the game, she will win significant sums of money.  
-- [E bewildered] But does my father earns enough?  
-- [G] Yes.  
-- [E confused] Is my mother delusional?  
-- [G laughing] Very possible. (G cares about the emotional well-being of E, and he cannot allow her to go through unnecessary anxiety. So he gets into logical explanations.) But you can help your mother by stopping to watch TV. When people watch TV, they also see advertisements, and those companies who place advertisements put money into the prize fund. So, if no one watches TV, there would be no prize money, and everyone, including your mother, will quit the show. In other words, if you stop watching A suffering, then the insensitive for A to suffer will disappear.

The next day at EDP (Extended Day Program) E talks to her friend/counselor B (short for Bob). She tells him that her mother is delusional. Her grandfather told her that to alleviate her mother's suffering, she should stop watching TV. But E wants to do more.  
-- [E] Would we organize some movement against watching TV that will help my mother more?  
-- [B] Maybe. But the show will end anyway. So, your mother will soon return in debilitated conditions, and thus it may be more prudent to prepare for her recovery process.

After thinking, E and her friends from EDP decided to plant a butterfly garden. B and G were resourceful and supportive.

One day A returns. Cheerfully she informs her daughter E that she won. E is sad and provides her mother with sincere condolences. E brings A to school, and they talk quietly on a bench in the butterfly garden.  
-- [E] G and I watched you once on the show. And we concluded that you were going crazy over nothing. B and G helped me and my friends build this garden for you. Is it beautiful?  
-- [A] Thank you. (After some pause.) Can you keep a secret?  
-- [E] Yes.  
-- [A] I was acting. Some were serious on this show about winning and participating in challenges. But I was acting. I wanted to be an actress on TV, so I signed up for the show and performed there dramatically.  
-- [E] Sorry, I watched only one episode where you were on a go-marry-round. Your role sucked, and your performance was too real; I meant too good.  
-- [A] Thank you. I promise that I will choose my next role more wisely.  
-- [E] But why should I keep a secret? What would happen if I told my friends you were just acting rather than going crazy?  
-- [A] Some may think they were setting up this beautiful garden for nothing, and their feelings will be hurt.  
-- [E] What should we do?  
-- [A] Would you agree that I will play the role of someone recovering from a mental crisis, and you will be my secret collaborator?  
-- [E] May I conspire with B and G?  
-- [A] Sure. Why not?.. Look, a butterfly landed on your sleeve!

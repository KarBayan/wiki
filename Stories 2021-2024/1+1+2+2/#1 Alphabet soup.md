*Following is an idea for a children's book or a TV series based on short stories where kids take the initiative to solve complicated problems of their parents and society. The solutions will be unconventional and naïve but valid. Implementation of kids' proposals will be a challenge for grownups. Let's start with the introduction of the main characters.*

### #1 Alphabet soup

A (short for Amelie) is a single woman about 40 years old that cannot have kids. A is a stereotypical humanitarian -- naïve, disorganized, and artistic. A can make things pretty and cozy but fails in goal-oriented activities. However, because A is so sweet and kind, good things just happen to her.

A really wants to marry and have kids, but making choices is extremely hard for her. Moreover, she can find a good side in any course of events -- she is unconditionally happy. So, A flips a coin to decide if she (a) 1st marries and then adopts a kid or (b) 1st adopts a kid and then marries. Fate chooses her path (b), and she adopts a girt E (short for Elizabeth) of 7 years of age, who is a character-wise identical copy of hers. Their philosophy and approach to life are best revealed in a scene when A puts E to sleep.  
-- [E] Life is so beautiful that it feels like a fairy tale. But why are there sad things? Why do people quarrel and fight?  
-- [A] (jokingly) People forget to believe in magic and make life too hard for themselves and others.  
-- [E] (seriously) How do you do magic?  
-- [A] You wish and believe that good things will happen and then act accordingly no matter what.  
-- [E] I wish I could also have a father.  
-- [A] It is a good wish. Starting tomorrow, we'll work on making it happen.

The following day E brings up the topic of obtaining the father during breakfast. A had several romantic affairs but absolutely lacks knowledge of establishing a long-term practical relationship. So, after school, while in the extended day program (EDP), E asks for advice from her counselor B (short for Bob). B is a 14-year boy from middle school. He is a resourceful, inventive get-things-done type of person, and he knows how to make and execute organized plans. Those are the qualities E admires and value in B.

B suggests setting up a schedule for A to start dating and evaluating potential candidates. Moreover, E will also meet with those men to see if she finds them likable as her father. E guides her mother accordingly. There are hilarious complications; for example, A believes that there cannot be any sex before marriage, and E thinks that those men who do not have kids living with them should have priority. Anyway, they end up with 3 candidates. But when it comes to making the final choice, the process stalls. A and E cannot decide because they like all 3 of them. Moreover, they think it would be rude to dump and upset any of those good men.

E turns for advice for B, and he tells her that open and sincere dialog can result in a decision satisfactory for all. So, E naively takes his advice literally and suggests her mother invite all candidates for a round-table group discussion. A reluctantly agrees.

3 candidates: C (short for Charles), D (short for Doug), and F arrive for dinner. It is a surprise for all of them that they have come to a group interview with A and E. F gets appalled and angry and leaves abruptly. E becomes upset, so C and D stay to have a meal with a meaningful and calm discussion. It ends with the following dialog.  
-- [E] (addressing C) Would you like to marry my mother and be my father?  
-- [C] Yes.  
-- [E] (addressing D) Would you be also happy to marry my mother and become my father?  
-- [D] Yes.  
-- [E] Then you can be both my fathers if you both marry my mother. Why not?  
-- [A] But darling, it is not how things work. It is not possible.  
-- [E] But mother, usually people marry and then have kids, but you first had me and only now is getting a husband. So, if you started acting differently, why not continue differently?

Grownups are bewildered and do not come up with a counterargument. Dinner ends. The next day at EDP, E talks to B.  
-- [E] Why is it impossible for my mother to marry both C and D?  
-- [B] Usually, 1 man marries 1 woman. However, 1 man can marry multiple women in Muslim countries, and that arrangement seemed to have been satisfactory for centuries. I need to become more familiar with the topic of marrying people.

B does some research on the internet and finds out that at age 14 he can become an ordained minister at The Universal Life Church [www.themonastery.org](https://www.themonastery.org/) by filling out a simple online form. And, for 35$, he can purchase a starter kit with 2 blank marriage certificates. E is excited, asks kids at EDP for help, and collects enough lunch money for a high school teenager to order this wedding kit on behalf of B. When back from school, E informs her mother that B has found a technical solution for the problem, and in several days he will be able to marry her with C and D -- she will have all the needed paperwork, 2 marriage certificates. There will be nothing to worry about, and she can be happy.

A panics and calls an emergency meeting with C, D, and O (short for Olga, B's mother) to figure out how to dissolve the situation. It is the first time O appears in the plot, and A and O were not acquainted before. It turns out that O is a single mother with a character opposite to A's -- very practical doer as her son B. O has a hard time finding logic in the feelings and actions of A and her daughter E. The following dialog takes place.  
-- [A] (responding to O) I often think I love everyone, and if you ask your heart, you might feel the same. But marriage is about practicality. For example, even if I love you, I won't propose to you because E wished for a father and I for a husband.  
-- [O] You are a strange group of people. (addressing C) Do you love me?  
-- [C] (smiling) Yes.  
-- [O] (jokingly addressing D) Will you marry me?  
-- [D] (seriously and thoughtfully) Yes. When I heard A speaking, I fell in love with you. I would be honored to have such a gorgeous, intelligent redheaded lady of a strong character as my wife. Moreover, I wished to have a son. Instead of going through the adoption hassle with A, I'd be happy to father your son B with you immediately.
